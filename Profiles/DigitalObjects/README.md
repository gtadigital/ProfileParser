# Digital Objects XSL-File

The present XSL-File extracts the direct links (URLs) each individual asset in the asset repository (EasyDB Asset Server). As input file you ay use a standard EasyDB output of Digital Objects. However, since the extracted set of information is quite limited, the present xsl tranformation is not suitable for a full ETL process meant to create proper RDF data.
